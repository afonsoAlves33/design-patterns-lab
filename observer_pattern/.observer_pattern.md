# Observer Pattern

The **Observer Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern that defines a **one-to-many dependency** between objects so that when one object (the **Subject**) changes its state, all its dependents (called **Observers**) are automatically notified and updated.

---

## ðŸ§  Intent

> Allow an object to notify other objects about changes in its state without tightly coupling them.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Participants

- **Subject (Observable)**:  
  Maintains a list of observers and provides methods to add, remove, and notify them.
  
- **Observer**:  
  Defines an interface for receiving updates from the subject.

|--------------|           |----------------|
| + attach()   |           | + update()     |
